\section{Introduction} 
Restaurants have become an integral part of the daily life of the average Nepali salaried class.  \cite{newbusiness}. Food has been considered as an important attraction for travelers, especially those who are traveling internally or abroad. As food tourism grows, food is becoming an important part of the marketing strategy of places of destination. Therefore, many destinations are trying to introduce or develop exotic foods to attract tourists by providing various culinary experiences.  \cite{lee2020influence}.

According to The Kathmandu Post, an estimated 15,000 restaurants and cafés are currently operating within the Kathmandu Valley. \cite{kathmandupost}. Rather than staying at home and cooking, people are spending that extra time (and money) to try new things in a city. \cite{newbusiness}. Due to increasing numbers of restaurants and cafés people are confused on what to try and where to try. Due to the bustling number of restaurants available, many people are unaware of the great places with good food near them. FoodFind helps them to find the restaurants or small café based on their tastes and preferences. It is aimed at both internal and external tourists who are unsure where to go for a meal nearby them. 

This project is an endeavor taken to contribute as much as we collectively can to help the people and the tourists flowing in the country by offering a platform that not only makes it easier to find high quality food, but also encourages a community of foodies eager to share their tastes with others.


\subsection{Project Overview}
FoodFind is a web app that helps users to find places nearby to eat. Users can sign up and start looking for restaurants right away. Once the user successfully signed up they can search for a restaurant by its name or where it’s located. Users can also choose what kind of food they want to eat. On FoodFind, users can look at menus, see how much things cost, and check out different kinds of food. They can also write reviews about the restaurants they visit to help other people know what’s good. Additionally, users can tell others where they’ve been by sharing the location. Users can also see the restaurants with the highest reviews, so they can decide where to go. For restaurants, FoodFind is a way to show off their food to more people. The app makes it easy for users to find exactly what they’re hungry for with filters for food type, place, and what other people say about the food.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
Kathmandu Valley, the capital of Nepal, is one of the country's busiest cities. Just like the thousands of people, It consists of many places to eat, from small food carts to big fancy restaurants. However, with an increasing number of restaurants, it is difficult for people to find the truly good ones. Both locals and visitors new to the city have difficulty finding the best places to eat and relax. As a result, some great places go unnoticed. There is also no easy way for people to find food that matches their tastes and food preferences.  Many people either ask locals or go to random places in search of good food. This makes it difficult for them to discover new favourite restaurants. FoodFind aims to address this by serving as a guide, assisting users in discovering great restaurants that match their preferences. FoodFind is a method of consistently providing them with information about unnoticed and unvisited places to eat, as well as encouraging them to share the locations with others so that others can enjoy their meals as well.

\subsection{Objectives}
To overcome the existing challenges and for alignment with our goals, the project aims to fulfill the objective listed below
\begin{itemize}
	\item  To develop a user-friendly platform to explore Kathmandu’s restaurant scene.
    \item To enhance online presence for local restaurants and facilitate the sharing of culinary reviews and experiences.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Significance of the Study}
The importance of the FoodFind project lies in its potential to transform the dining landscape of the Kathmandu Valley. By providing a user-friendly platform, it enables locals and internal or external tourists to discover and enjoy a variety of dishes that suit their taste, preferences and location. This will not only make it easier to find quality restaurants, cafés or local eateries, but will also help create a vibrant community of food lovers who can share their valuable reviews and recommendations. In addition, it offers restaurants a valuable opportunity to showcase their offerings and attract new people, helping them grow their business and the local food industry. In short, FoodFind aims to enrich the dining experience for everyone and support restaurants and local restaurants to grow their business.


\subsection{Scope and Limitations}
In the current scope, FoodFind aims to be a user-friendly web app that connects food lovers with a wide variety of dining options. It’s designed to simplify the search for good eats, whether you’re a local or a visitor. The platform will offer detailed information about restaurants, including menus, prices, and user reviews, making it easier for everyone to find the perfect meal to match their preferences and budget.

The following are the limitations of the project that are realized:
\begin{itemize}
 	\item  Initially, FoodFind will only cover restaurants, cafés and local food place within Kathmandu Valley, which might limit options for users outside the city.
	\item Users will need a stable internet connection to access the app, which could be a barrier in areas with poor connectivity.
    \item The success of the app relies heavily on users actively sharing their dining experiences, and less participation could affect the quality and quantity of reviews and recommendations.
 \end{itemize}

\section{Literature Review}
Restaurant discovery applications have revolutionized the way people find, choose, and experience dining options. They leverage user-centered design, data analytics, and community engagement to provide personalized and practical solutions. The "FoodFind" web app aims to assist users in finding restaurants that align with their culinary preferences by offering filters, reviews, and menu browsing features, promoting a supportive ecosystem around dining. This literature review explores various aspects of restaurant discovery and community engagement through similar applications to understand how FoodFind fits into the broader context.

\subsection{User-Centric Design in Restaurant Discovery Apps}
User-centric design is vital in improving user satisfaction and engagement in restaurant discovery apps. According to Ghani and Suleman (2020), personalization significantly impacts user experience, as users prefer recommendations based on their tastes and preferences. They discuss how features like filtering by cuisine type, location, and reviews improve the accuracy of recommendations. \cite{ghani2020restaurant}. 
 Community-driven reviews provide social validation, aiding in decision-making \cite{pantelidis2019social}Similarly, in their study on mobile applications for food services, Alomari et al. (2019) emphasize the importance of customizable filtering options that allow users to refine searches according to specific requirements such as budget or dietary restrictions\cite{alomari2019mobile}.

\subsection{Community Engagement and Social Influence}
The role of community engagement is crucial in restaurant discovery apps, as it fosters trust and enhances user engagement. Research by Pantelidis (2019) highlights how user reviews influence consumer perceptions and behavior. Social influence plays a significant role in shaping users' dining preferences and encourages active participation \cite{pantelidis2019social}. Another study by Zhang et al. (2021) supports the notion that community engagement through reviews and recommendations helps build a supportive ecosystem where users share experiences and discover quality dining options  \cite{zhang2021food}.

\subsection{Technical Framework and Data Management}
Although FoodFind's abstract does not delve into technical details, understanding the technical framework is crucial for improving restaurant discovery apps. In their work, Singh et al. (2020) describe a system architecture based on machine learning algorithms that predict user preferences using data collected from past behavior. The use of clustering techniques, collaborative filtering, and content-based filtering can significantly enhance recommendation accuracy \cite{singh2020restaurant}. Furthermore, ensuring data integrity and regularly updating restaurant information, such as menus and prices, can vastly improve user trust and engagement \cite{serrano2020food}.Expanding international availability and handling scalability are essential challenges in restaurant discovery \cite{bianchini2017restaurant}

\subsection{Gaps and Opportunities}
Despite the comprehensive features provided by restaurant discovery apps, certain gaps and areas of improvement remain :

\begin{itemize}
        \item Diversity in Listings : Expanding listings to include a wider variety of cuisines and dining experiences enhances inclusivity \cite{tanta2021inclusivity}.
	\item Enhanced Personalization : Incorporating machine learning algorithms for more personalized recommendations remains a challenge \cite{singh2020restaurant}.
 	\item Regular Data Updates : Ensuring menus and prices are accurate and updated regularly requires better partnerships with restaurants \cite{serrano2020food}.
\end{itemize}

\pagebreak








\section{Methodology}
This section includes the methodology that is being followed during the development of the project.


\subsection{Technical Architecture}
React.js and Django REST Framework (DRF) interact to form a robust client-server setup. React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, is utilized on the client side to create a dynamic and responsive experience for users. It manages the presentation layer, handling user interactions, data presentation, and sending requests to the server. On the server side, Django REST Framework acts as the backend, handling data management, business logic, and API endpoints. DRF receives HTTP requests from the React.js frontend, processes these requests (such as user authentication, data retrieval, and manipulation), and sends back the appropriate responses in JSON format, which React.js then uses to update the user interface. This separation of concerns ensures that the frontend and backend are loosely coupled, promoting scalability and ease of maintenance while enabling efficient development workflows where frontend and back-end developers can work independently yet collaboratively.

 \cite{garner2021}
\end{figure}
\pagebreak


\subsection{Software Development Life Cycle}
We’ll adopt the Incremental Software Development Model, tackling requirements, research design, training, evaluation, and documentation in iterative cycles.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{iteration}
	\centering
	\caption{Incremental model}
	\label{fig:iteration}
\end{figure}

In the first increment, we’ll analyze the project’s requirements, defining its scope, objectives, and constraints. For FOODFIND, this translates to pinpointing the system’s essential characteristics, such as restaurant menu and food data modeling, user profile, user reviews and recommendation. We’ll then embark on crucial research, gathering and examining data that aligns with these objectives. This entails investigating existing platforms providing similar services. We’ll gather the required data for the application using platforms providing dataset for testing purposes.

The second increment focuses on design, prototyping, and early testing. We’ll thoroughly plan the FOODFIND implementation, designing the system architecture, selecting suitable technologies, and developing streamlined prototypes to demonstrate core functionalities. This is followed by coding the core business logic and integrating them with the data sources. Rigorous tests will be conducted to validate initial functionality and identify potential areas for improvement. While initial deployment isn’t the primary focus here, preliminary feedback from the supervisor and the test results are valuable for ensuring the system is on track to meet the defined requirements.

The third increment revolves around refinement, integration, and enhanced testing. We’ll revisit and reiterate the requirements based on insights from testing, supervisor feedback, and evolving project goals. The research phase might involve acquiring additional data sets and investigating new research advancements. Taking into account the findings from the previous increment, we’ll optimize the system architecture, enhance the algorithms, and integrate feedback to improve the user interface. This phase also plays a more critical role in evaluation and improvement, quantifying the system’s effectiveness and identifying opportunities for further refinement.

The fourth increment marks the deployment, monitoring, and continuous improvement stage. The requirement analysis becomes an ongoing process, adapting to evolving business needs and incorporating user feedback. We’ll continuously benefit from new research findings allowing for ongoing adaptation. Finally, the evaluation and improvement become long-term endeavors, monitoring the system’s performance, gathering user feedback, and continuously improving the system.

\section{Recommendation Algorithms}
The recommendation system in the FoodFind project is designed to provide personalized restaurant suggestions to users based on their preferences and interactions. The algorithm employs a hybrid approach, combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques
\subsection{Data Retrieval}

The algorithm starts by retrieving relevant data based on user interactions and specified parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User ID}: Identifies the user for whom recommendations are to be generated.
    \item \textbf{Recommendation Flag}: Determines if recommendations are requested.
    \item \textbf{Tags}: Filters restaurants based on specified tags.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Collaborative Filtering}

Collaborative filtering generates recommendations by identifying similarities between users. This involves:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Favorites and Reviews}: Collecting the list of favorite restaurants and reviews for the specified user.
    \item \textbf{Identifying Similar Users}: Finding other users who share similar tastes by checking for overlapping favorite restaurants and reviewed restaurants.
    \item \textbf{Generating Collaborative Recommendations}: Recommending restaurants that are liked or reviewed by these similar users but not by the current user.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Content-Based Filtering}

Content-based filtering uses the attributes of restaurants to find items similar to those the user already likes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Tags}: Identifying tags associated with the user’s favorite restaurants.
    \item \textbf{Generating Content Recommendations}: Selecting restaurants that match these tags, ensuring they share characteristics with those that the user has already shown interest in.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Combining Recommendations: Hybrid Filtering}

The algorithm combines the results from collaborative filtering and content-based filtering:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Union of Recommendations}: Merging the collaborative and content-based recommendations to form a unique set of suggested restaurants.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Annotation and Sorting}

To present the most relevant recommendations, the algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Annotates Recommendations}: Adds metadata such as average ratings and the number of reviews to each restaurant.
    \item \textbf{Sorting}: Orders the restaurants by average rating and review count, ensuring the highest-rated and most-reviewed options are prioritized.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Handling No Recommendations}

If the algorithm does not generate any specific recommendations, it defaults to returning the entire list of available restaurants, ensuring that the user always receives some suggestions.

\pagebreak
\section{Performance Analysis Methodology}

In order to make this project effective and robust, we will be making sure it adheres to top notch quality by testing it with different performance metrics, validation scheme and benchmark tests. 

\subsection{Data Management}
